# mcbe-realms

A JS wrapper for the MCBE realms API.

Everything is decently documented so you can look around and do whatever you want with it.

**NOTE:** This is weakly tested, so there's no guarantees that _everything_ is working, however I will have tested the majority of stuff.

[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mcbe-realms) - [github](https://github.com/CarpalEnderman/mcbe-realms.js)

## Versions

### 1.0.3

- Added typescript typings for the module, generated from the JSDoc comments within the code. These are located in `/typings`
- Renamed the `User` class to `Client` to make it more fitting.
